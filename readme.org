Ruinit is a small testing library that can be used as an interface wrapper around [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/][rackunit]].
Ruinit aims to mitigate issues around test composition and error reporting to allow building complex tests from smaller ones while maintaining good error reporting.

See the documentation for more information.

Note that this package is still in an experimental stage and under active development, so things may change.
